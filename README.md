# Life Expectancy Model

This project is part of my endeavour toward an actuarial career. It’s a survival model built using UK life table data to calculate:

- Probability of survival and death at each age
- Present value of annuities and life expectancies
- Core components of CM1 (Actuarial Mathematics) syllabus

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Python (NumPy, Pandas)

## Status
In Progress — building the Excel framework before translating to Python
